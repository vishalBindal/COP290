Major assignment

To run:
1) make
2) ./main <path to doc 1> <path to doc 2>
e.g. ./main doc1.txt doc2.txt

Output:
Values printed on console
Plot saved in output directory


I have implemented a lexer, to tokenize words, punctuations, special words (containing upto 3 letters of vishal) and end of sentence (EOS)
Then in the parser, the tokens are used to count the various parameters. The plot is then plotted using gnuplot.

I have named all variables as ending with 25. (not the tokens)
